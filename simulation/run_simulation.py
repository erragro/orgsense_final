Kirana Kart Synthetic Data Simulation
======================================
Creates:
  - 100 synthetic customers (varied platforms, risk profiles, LTV tiers)
  - 500 tickets via Cardinal ingest API (all issue types, varied routing outcomes)
  - Assigns HITL/MANUAL_REVIEW queue entries to the 3 CRM groups

Prerequisites:
  kubectl port-forward -n auralis svc/postgres 5432:5432 &

Usage:
  cd /Users/apple/Documents/kirana_kart_final
  python simulation/run_simulation.py

Cost note:
  500 tickets × ~3 LLM calls each ≈ 1500 GPT API calls.
  Most are gpt-4o-mini (cheap); complex cases use gpt-4.1.
  Estimated: ~$4–8 total.
